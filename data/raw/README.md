This folder contains the raw data of our study. The data come in different folders, which we kept separate because each was collected by a different investigator or on a different island, and follows a different naming convention. Regardless, each folder consists of the same thing: a list of reflectance files, as produced by a reflectance spectrometer (those always have the same format). Those reflectance files do not contain any metadata about the individual that was measured, except from a tag and a number indicating which spot on the dewlap was measured (1 = throat, 2 = center, 3 = edge). The file `master_database.csv` contains the necessary tags to retrieve the identity and provenance of each measured lizard.
