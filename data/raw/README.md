This folder contains the raw data of our study. The data come in different folders, which we kept separate because each was collected by different investigators on different islands, and each following a slightly different file naming convention. 
Regardless, each folder consists of the same thing: a list of reflectance files, as produced by a reflectance spectrometer Ocean Optics USB4000 (light was emitted with a pulsed Xenon light source, the measuring probe was protected by a black anodized aluminum sheath, and measurements were taken at a 45 degree angle). 
Each reflectance file contains a header with the relevant machine settings for that measurement.
Then, reflectance (in percents, right column) is recorded at a high resolution along wavelengths from ~170 to ~890nm (left column).
As this is way outside of the range visible to most animals we followed the usual convention in vertebrate studies to only consider the range from 300 to 700nm.
Each reflectance file is one measurement and contains in its name the field tag of the individual being measureed as well as a number representing which where on the dewlap the probe was applied (1 = throat, 2 = center, 3 = edge).
We only considered dewlap center (spot = 2) in this study as those were the most reliable measurements.
