Most of the data files here are automatically generated from the raw data. Do not edit by hand.

## Content

* `raw`: the folder containing all the raw reflectance spectra
* `counts.csv`: the sample sizes in each habitat on each island
* `island_coordinates.csv`: used to generate the maps
* `reflectance.csv`: the processed and curated reflectance profiles used in the analyses
* `sites.csv`: summarized phenotype (in PC space) for each site on each island
* `specs.rds`: raw reflectance spectra already loaded into R (can be used to save time when replicating the study)
