Dear Author,

Thank you for submitting your manuscript "Dewlap color variation in Anolis sagrei is maintained among habitats within islands of the West Indies" (JEB-2021-00274) to the Journal of Evolutionary Biology. Your submission has now been assessed by two reviewers, whose comments are included below. While I agree with reviewer 2 that this is a very nice paper with interesting results that could possibly be published as it stands, I also agree with reviewer 1 that an obvious ommision is any analysis of if or how the light environments differ between habitats and islands. How similar are the habitats between islands or could differences in habitat between islands explain some of the variation between islands? Including data and analysis on the differences in light environment between the habitats (and islands), and possibly doing some visual modelling (which I think would require information on the light environment), would move this from being a very good to an excellent paper. I would therefore like to give you to opportunity to consider these suggestions and whether you have or can reasonably obtain the data to do these analyses. One other more minor point is that lack of evidence for spatial autocorrelation is not the same as evidence for a lack of spatial autocorrelation (indeed there is a reasonably strong, albeit not quite "significant" spatial correlation on Eleuthera), so some of the conclusions about a lack of isolation by distance and genetic drift should be toned down slightly. The reviewers also raise some other minor comments that should be addressed.

Please submit your revised paper in an editable format within eight weeks of this letter, otherwise it will be considered a new submission You can do so by clicking on the link 'Manuscripts with Decisions' in your Author Centre.

When you submit the revision, please include a letter describing how you have responded to each of the referees’ comments. Please number the comments and refer to line numbers in the revised manuscript for easy reference. Ensure you upload this letter with your other documents so it forms part of the overall PDF document (note that there is a file designation called "Author response to Reviewer").

Review of “Dewlap color variation in Anolis sagrei is maintained among habitats within islands of the West Indies”

This paper explored dewlap colour variation of Anolis sagrei in three different habitats (beach scrub, primary coppice forest and mangrove forest) across nine different islands in the Bahamas and Cayman islands. Previous studies have shown colour variation in anole dewlap between habitats, and the sensory drive hypothesis is one of the possible explanations of the maintenance of such diversity. The novelty of this study is that authors tested such hypothesis by characterizing dewlap colour variation within and between closely located habitats, thus, in presence of gene flow. Authors clearly stated and tested three main hypotheses related to the sensory drive hypothesis in this context: 1) light conditions associated to each habitat type drive colour evolution, making dewlap colour in similarly illuminated habitats more similar (dewlap coloration in beach scrub and mangrove forest will then be more similar in comparison to coppice forest); 2) darker and more contrasting dewlaps are expected to be found at beach scrub and mangrove forest, where irradiance is higher; 3) if light conditions are indeed driving colour variation, patterns should be similar across islands. Authors sampled dewlap reflectance each 11.2 km (median between sampling points within an island). Such reflectance profiles were reduced using a PCA. A random forest algorithm was then used together to other statistical test to explore the colour differences that could be found between and within habitats. Spatial autocorrelation was taken into account as well. Authors detected significant differences between habitats within seven out of nine islands, but such differences follow different directions and occur on different zones of the reflectance spectra between islands. They also found differences in dewlap coloration between closely located populations that differ in habitat type. Largest differences were found between islands.

Authors did a great job at designing this experiment and at combining diverse statistical analyses that enable testing their hypotheses taking into account potential sources of noise such as geographical proximity. I have one major suggestion/comment. Do you know whether such colour variation nicely described by your analyses, is actually detectable by conspecific, congeners and/or predators, the “agents” of selection?  For instance, do you think all dewlaps will be similarly seen under similar light/background conditions? Or whether observers can tell apart dewlaps coming from different habitats? In the first case, it is likely that the non-directional variation that you describe is not under selection, as to observers’ eyes, all dewlap colours look similar. In the second case, the conclusions will be similar to the ones you get with your current approach. This question can be tested applying vision modelling using your reflectance profiles, and an irradiance profile of at least one of the habitats that you studied. Perhaps this has been already done in other studies. If such is the case, you can clearly mention it.  

Other remarks:
-Among the differences that can be found on the three studied habitats, authors mostly talk about differences in light incidence. Are there any differences also in background colour? Predator community? Anole community? If so, how will they contribute or not to the obtained results?
-How big is the home range of an Anolis? Sorry of I missed it. This information will help understanding the importance of your experimental design.
-In line 91, what do you mean by climatic variables? Light incidence?
-In line 413, perhaps is worth it including a short definition of runaway sexual selection.

Comments to the Author
It is with great interest and enthusiasm that I’ve read the manuscript entitled “Dewlap color variation in Anolis sagrei is maintained among habitats within islands of the West Indies”. In their study, the authors test the hypothesis that similar local adaptive processes occur over small spatial scales by investigating differentiation of dewlap coloration among habitat types at a small spatial scale. Surprisingly, the authors find that habitat-specific dewlap differences varied in direction/degree across island and thus only find little support for adaptive parallel responses across islands; they elaborately discuss this finding in their manuscript.

Both as a reviewer and an evolutionary ecologist with an interest in animal communication and lizard biology, I can honestly say that this manuscript was truly a pleasure to read, and by far the ‘most finished piece of work’ I’ve ever reviewed. First of all, the writing is excellent. The authors succeed in introducing the topic and hypothesis clearly and elegantly; they describe the methods and statistics understandably and in detail; and they elaborately discuss their findings in a broad evolutionary framework. Also, the authors do a great job in citing and referring to the proper and relevant studies. I am not familiar with the machine learning statistics, so I cannot comment on that.

While I believe it is the role of a reviewer to attempt to improve the scientific value of the manuscript, I am afraid there is only little I can contribute to this manuscript. Congratulations to the authors!

I have only one minor suggestion/comment. The study focuses on the colouration of the dewlap. Of course, also the size and use of the dewlap is essential during signalling (see e.g. papers by Lailvaux, Irschick, Vanhooydonck, Driessens, Husak, Baeckens, to name a few). While I understand this is not the goal of the study, I think it’s still important to invest a couple of sentences or a short paragraph on how other characteristics of the dewlap (aside from colouration) are important too, and that those characteristics (possibly interaction with colouration) might vary within- and among-islands as well.
