% Extra results to get: minimum distance at which we found differences and range-wide results

% There are inconsistent differences that are not explained by distance

\paragraph{Dewlap coloration differs between habitat-types} We found that male dewlap coloration in \textit{A. sagrei} significantly varied between habitat-types (beach scrub bush, primary coppice forest and mangrove forest) on five islands of the West Indies: Abaco, Bimini, Cayman Brac, Little Cayman and Long Island. However, the habitat-specific variation in dewlaps was not consistent between these islands. Although those results are consistent with adaptation at a very local scale, other evolutionary drivers could be at work, including phenotypic plasticity, random drift, or historical contingency including multiple colonization events. We reject this last explanation because all of the island populations in this study are strictly monophyletic, implying a single colonization event per island (van de Schoot, unpublished thesis; \citealt{Driessens2017}). While random drift cannot be completely ruled out, we see little evidence for a role of phenotypic isolation-by-distance (spatial autocorrelation) in explaining the differences we report. While we found a significant signal of isolation-by-distance on Eleuthera, we did not detect differences in dewlap coloration between habitats on this island.

% Plasticity is unlikely

\paragraph{A role of phenotypic plasticity is unlikely} Phenotypic plasticity could explain differences in coloration between habitat populations because of diet differences. The yellow, orange and red coloration in anoline dewlaps are produced by pterins and carotenoids \citep{Ortiz1962, Ortiz1962a, Ortiz1963, Ortiz1966, Macedonia2000, Steffen2007, Steffen2009}. Animals lack the ability to synthesize carotenoids, and those must therefore be found in the diet, while pterins are synthesized from nucleotides \citep{Goodwin1984, Hill2002, Hill2006}. Experimental manipulation of dietary carotenoid content showed no effect on dewlap coloration in \textit{A. sagrei} \citep{Steffen2010} nor in \textit{A. distichus} \citep{Ng2013}, another species with an orange-based dewlap. Plasticity due to differences in development (e.g. egg rearing conditions) is unlikely because dewlap coloration develops at sexual maturity \citep{Ng2013}. \citet{Cox2017} further found a high degree of heritability of dewlap coloration in \textit{A. sagrei}. These studies suggest that dewlap coloration is not a plastic trait, although transgenerational plastic effects cannot be completely ruled out by these one or two-generation common garden experiments \citep{Tariel2020}. That leaves an adaptive explanation, where dewlap color could be under differential natural and/or sexual selection in these different habitats.

% The maintenance of divergence in the face of gene flow

\paragraph{Divergence is maintained in the face of gene flow} The small spatial scale (the median distance between island sample sites was 11.2km + mention the minimum distance at which we found differences) and the lack of geographic barriers within islands, together with the high mobility \textit{A. sagrei} individuals \citep{Kamath2018}, imply ample opportunity for extensive gene flow between the populations in this study. In agreement with this, populations from different habitats were found to not be monophyletic based on <insert marker name here> (van de Schoot et al. unpublished thesis). While gene flow is expected to erase any differences acquired by drift without selection maintaining such polymorphism \citep{Dieckmann1999}, these divergent patterns remain, which may support an adaptive explanation. Maintenance of dewlap color divergence despite gene flow has been found in \textit{A. distichus} in Hispaniola \citep{Ng2012, Ng2016} and proposed as a mechanism of reproductive isolation in the early stages of speciation \citep{Ng2011, Lambert2013, Ng2017}. \citet{Stapley2011} found that dewlap color polymorphism was maintained in the absence of genetic structure between populations of \textit{A. apletophallus} from Panama. \citet{Thorpe2002a} found that divergence in dewlap coloration matched habitat-type better than mitochondrial lineage in \textit{A. roquet} on Martinique, and a convergent pattern was found in \textit{A. trinitatis} on the featureless island of St Vincent \citep{Thorpe2002b}. Divergence in body coloration, but not dewlap coloration, was also reported in \textit{A. conspersus} on another small island, Grand Cayman \citep{Macedonia2001}. Those results suggest a high adaptive potential of the anoline dewlap.

% The evidence for sexual selection

\paragraph{Sexual selection could be at play} Substantial levels of promiscuity in \textit{A. sagrei} suggest ample opportunity for female mate choice and sexual selection \citep{Kamath2018}. A number of studies suggest that characteristics of the dewlap are indicators of male quality and may therefore act as a cue in mate choice, according to the "good genes" model of sexual selection \citep{Andersson1994}. \citet{Cook2013} found lower orange reflectance in dewlaps with heavily parasitized \textit{A. brevirostris}, suggesting a trade-off in carotenoid use between the immune response and pigment deposition. \citet{Steffen2014} found that lower UV and orange-red reflectance predict contest-winning success between males. \citet{Driessens2015} further found that more yellow and red dewlaps (relative to UV) predict better body condition, and that higher yellow and UV reflectance at the margin of the dewlap predict higher hematocrit (the concentration of red blood cells), indicating a better health. Other aspects of the dewlap may be important for sexual selection, for example, dewlap size correlates with bite force \citep{Vanhooydonck2005} and sexual size dimorphism (a proxy for sexual selection; \citealt{Vanhooydonck2009}). Even though display frequency increases in the presence of females \citep{Driessens2014}, there seems to be no link between dewlap display frequency and mating success \citep{Tokarz2002, Tokarz2005} or individual quality \citep{Driessens2015}. Our report of inconsistent divergence between islands, however, is at odds with the good-genes model of sexual selection, which would predict the evolution of dewlap coloration in the same direction across the archipelago. This is consistent with \citet{Baeckens2018}, who found no link between the average island-dewlap coloration and sexual size dimorphism in \textit{A. sagrei} across the West Indies. If sexual selection is at play in our system, it more likely involves divergent female preferences that are not linked to male quality but rather to components of the environment, and may well be arbitrary (Fisherian sexual selection; \citealt{Andersson1994}).

% Could there be local adaptation? To what?

\paragraph{Dewlap coloration could be locally adapted} Presently, we do not know the adaptive drivers of dewlap  color divergence observed in this study. Some degree of parallel evolution is usually a good indicator for an adaptive process \citep{Losos2011}, and convergent patterns of dewlap color evolution in similar environments across islands and species have been documented \citep{Thorpe2002a, Thorpe2002b}. Here, we found evidence for a few consistencies in within-island divergence across the nine islands studied (show some archipelago-wide results?); dewlap brightness was lower in the primary coppice habitat on three islands, and the primary coppice habitat was intermediate in coloration between mangrove and beach scrub on two islands. Those patterns could reflect adaptation to components of the habitat \citep{Endler1988}. However, it is not clear what those components of the habitat might be. Previous studies have found that dewlap coloration maximizes detectability given the light conditions in the local habitat, primarily through UV contrast -- with UV-brighter dewlaps in UV-dark, mesic habitats and UV-darker dewlaps in UV-bright, xeric habitats -- in \textit{A. cristatellus} and \textit{A. cooki} on Puerto Rico \citep{Leal2002, Leal2004}. We found no such pattern in \textit{A. sagrei}, where instead, we found the darkest dewlaps in the darkest, mesic habitat -- primary coppice forest -- on three islands, and dewlaps often differed the most between beach scrub and mangrove forest, two xeric habitats with similar, high irradiance levels \citep{Howard1950, Schoener1968}. The inconsistent and idiosyncratic patterns we observed suggest that dewlap color variation between habitats cannot be predicted by habitat identity alone. Studies of Jamaican and Hispaniolan anoles similarly found between-habitat differences in dewlap coloration but no evidence for higher detectability \citep{Fleishman2009, Ng2012}. Habitats on different islands may also differ in other aspects than light conditions such as densities of predators or other anole species, which have been shown to affect among-island dewlap diversity \citep{Vanhooydonck2009, Baeckens2018}. In particular, \citet{Baeckens2018} recently showed that dewlaps with spotted patterns occurred more often in \textit{A. sagrei} on islands with more coexisting species of anoles.

% Conclusion, and a word about speciation

\paragraph{Implications in the context of speciation} Local adaptation can be a precursor to ecological speciation, a process that may have given rise to the adaptive radiation of \textit{Anolis} lizards \citep{Harmon2003, Gavrilets2009}. Ecologically-mediated divergence of a sexual signal may be a potent path to the evolution of reproductive isolation through divergent sexual selection \citep{Reynolds2007, Servedio2011}. Evidence suggests that dewlap coloration could take this role in anoles \citep{Ng2011, Lambert2013, Geneva2015, Ng2017}, or at least that it is frequently involved in species recognition \citep{Williams1969, Williams1977, Losos1985, Macedonia1994, Fleishman2000, Macedonia2013, Ingram2016, Baeckens2018}. Although this signal is not detected at the phylogenetic scale of the whole genus \citep{Nicholson2007, Harrison2012, Ingram2016}, sexual signals are often evolutionarily very labile \citep{Kraaijeveld2011}, and the anole dewlap in particular is capable of rapid macroevolution; for example, \textit{A. conspersus} on Grand Cayman evolved a UV-blue dewlap from an ancestral orange dewlap in 2 to 3 million years \citep{Macedonia2001}. We present evidence of multiple cases of potentially adaptive maintenance of habitat-associated dewlap divergence over small geographical scale in \textit{A. sagrei} across the West Indies. While these populations do not appear to be in the process of speciation, our results strongly suggest that the anoline dewlap has enough micro-scale, local adaptive potential to participate in the build-up of reproductive isolation, should it be recruited for assortative mating.
