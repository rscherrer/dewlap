The dashed line represents the density of a corresponding null binomial distribution, which would be expected under random guessing (testing sets with 20\% of the observations for each island and success probability of $1/3$). Inset plots show the corresponding average confusion matrices and represent the proportion of lizards from each habitat (columns) reassigned in each other habitat (rows), with an interpretation guide in the right panel. P-values indicate deviations of the mean classification accuracy to the expected null binomial distribution. *, P < 0.05}
