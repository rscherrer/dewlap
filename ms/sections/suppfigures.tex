Here we report, for each pair of habitats, the distances between sites that significantly differed in dewlap coloration at an error rate of 0.05 (P-values corrected with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for multiple testing).}

Differences in habitat-means, or contrasts, are shown for two pairs of habitats for each principal component on each island, rescaled so the standard deviation of the means along each principal component is one. The contrasts represent the patterns of between-habtiat variation on each island, for a given principal component. The absence of clustering of islands by variable indicates that islands differ in their between-habitat divergence patterns. This is confirmed by a non-significant MANOVA test of the between versus within-variable variance in contrasts.}
