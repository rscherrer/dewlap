	\caption{Test of spatial autocorrelation. For each island are shown the correlation (Pearson's $\rho$) between the matrix of phenotypic distances between populations from each site and the matrix of geographic distances between sites, where phenotypic distances are Euclidean distances between the mean phenotypes of each site in the multivariate space consisting of the first four within-island principal components. P-values assess the significance of the observed correlation against the correlation expected if lizards were randomly permuted among sites (1,000 permutations). *, $P < 0.05$; **, $P < 0.01$, ***, $P < 0.001$.}

Model, best-fitting model (either OLS or GLS). AICc, corrected AIC score of the best-fitting model. $\Delta$AICc, difference in AICc between the best-fitting model and the OLS-model. AICcw, AICc weight. Log-lik., log-likelihood. $\chi^2$, likelihood ratio.  df, degrees of freedom. *, $P < 0.05$; **, $P < 0.01$, ***, $P < 0.001$.}
