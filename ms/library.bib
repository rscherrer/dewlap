  abstract = {Animal signalling structures are amongst the most variable characteristics, as they are subjected to a diversity of selection pressures. A well-known example of a diverse signalling system in the animal kingdom is the dewlap of               Anolis               lizards. Dewlap characteristics can vary remarkably among and within species, and also between sexes. Although a considerable amount of studies have attempted to disentangle the functional significance of the staggering dewlap diversity in               Anolis               , the underlying evolutionary processes remain elusive. In this study, we focus on the contribution of biotic selective pressures in shaping geographic variation in dewlap design (size, colour, and pattern) and dewlap display behaviour at the intraspecific level. Notably, we have tried to replicate and extend previously reported results hereof in both sexes of the brown anole lizard (               Anolis sagrei               ). To do this, we assembled a dataset consisting of 17               A. sagrei               heterogeneous island populations from the Caribbean and specifically tested whether predation pressure, sexual selection, or species recognition could explain interpopulational variation in an array of dewlap characteristics. Our findings show that in neither males nor females estimates of predation pressure (island size, tail break frequency, model attack rate, presence of predatory               Leiocephalus               lizards) or sexual selection (sexual size dimorphism) could explain variation in dewlap design. We did find that               A. sagrei               males from larger islands showed higher dewlap display intensities than males from smaller islands, but the direct connection with predation pressure remains ambiguous and demands further investigation. Last, we could show indirect support for species recognition only in males, as they are more likely to have a `spotted' dewlap pattern when co-occurring with a higher number of syntopic               Anolis               species. In conclusion, we found overall limited support for the idea that the extensive interpopulational variability in dewlap design and use in               A. sagrei               is mediated by variation in their biotic environment. We propose a variety of conceptual and methodological explanations for this unexpected finding.},

Taking this heterogeneity into account is necessary to obtain accurate estimates of the underlying population dynamics. We present a new multitype birth\textendash death model (MTBD) that can estimate lineage-specific birth and death rates. This corresponds to estimating lineage-dependent speciation and extinction rates for species phylogenies, and lineage-dependent transmission and recovery rates for pathogen transmission trees. In contrast with previous models, we do not presume to know the trait driving the rate differences, nor do we prohibit the same rates from appearing in different parts of the phylogeny. Using simulated data sets, we show that the MTBD model can reliably infer the presence of multiple evolutionary regimes, their positions in the tree, and the birth and death rates associated with each. We also present a reanalysis of two empirical data sets and compare the results obtained by MTBD and by the existing software BAMM. We compare two implementations of the model, one exact and one approximate (assuming that no rate changes occur in the extinct parts of the tree), and show that the approximation only slightly affects results. The MTBD model is implemented as a package in the Bayesian inference software BEAST 2 and allows joint inference of the phylogeny and the model parameters.[Birth\textendash death; lineage specific rates, multi-type model.]},

  abstract = {Although the visual display behavior in Anolis lizards has received ample attention, the function of dewlap extensions (DE), push-ups (PU), and head-nods (HN) in general, and in Anolis sagrei in particular, remains highly equivocal. Therefore, our primary goal was to quantify the display rates of these visual signal types (DE, PU, and HN) in a variety of contexts, using A. sagrei as study species. To our knowledge, this is the first study to test individuals of both sexes in a repeated-measures design across multiple contexts, including predator, non-predator and social interactions (mirror, male\textendash male, male\textendash female, female\textendash male). We found that males have an overall higher signaling rate than females across all contexts. In addition, we found that lizards of both sexes exhibited higher display rates in the presence of conspecifics than when confronted with a predator or non-predator, suggesting that DE, PU, and HN function in intraspecific communication, not in predator deterrence. Whereas females did not significantly raise display rates in a consexual and heterosexual context with respect to subject-alone context, males did. The PU signal type only appears to play a major role for A. sagrei males during aggressive encounters. During heterosexual interactions, increased frequencies of all signal types suggest that DE, PU, and HN are essential for male courtship. Finally, we suggest that intersexual selection is probably a driving force for frequency-related dewlap use in both sexes. In contrast, pronounced intersexual differences were detected for PU and HN rates within a social context.},

Yet, the functions and multiple messages conveyed by the dewlap remain largely unknown. Here, we assess some aspects of sexual identity, individual quality, and social status that may be signaled by the dewlap in both sexes of Anolis sagrei. In addition, we investigate whether diverse facets of dewlap signaling provide additive information (redundant message hypothesis) or highlight different characteristics of the sender (multiple-message hypothesis). To do so, components of dewlap design (area, color, and pattern ratio) and use (dewlap extension frequency during intersexual context) were quantified and investigated for relationships with sexual identity (sex), individual quality (performance and health state measurements), and social status (mirror-motivated aggression). First, we found that body size together with relative dewlap area and color act as redundant messages in the advertisement of sexual identity. Second, we found that dewlap coloration in the center and edge region signals aspects of individual quality, specifically health state, but only in males. The dewlap center and edge acts primarily as redundant signals, at least for body condition and immune response. However, different color components irrespective of dewlap region convey nonredundant information about aspects of health state in males, supporting the multiple-message hypothesis. Surprisingly, dewlap use in A. sagrei males conveyed no information about the tested quality measurements nor about mirror-motivated aggression. Neither dewlap design nor use in females was related to any of these parameters. In contrast to males, correlations between components of dewlap design and use during intersexual interactions were found for females, suggesting important signaling functions of the female dewlap in a courtship context.},

The astonishing dewlap diversity in anoles has attracted considerable attention in this respect. Yet, the evolutionary processes behind it remain elusive and have mostly been explored for males only. Here, we considered Anolis sagrei males and females to study signal divergence among populations. First, we assessed the degree of variation in dewlap design (size, pattern and colour) and displays by comparing 17 populations distributed across the Caribbean. Second, we assessed whether the observed dewlap diversity is associated with variation in climate-related environmental conditions. Results showed that populations differed in all dewlap characteristics, with the exception of display rate in females. We further found that males and females occurring in `xeric' environments had a higher proportion of solid dewlaps with higher UV reflectance. In addition, lizards inhabiting `mesic' environments had primarily marginal dewlaps showing high reflectance in red. For dewlap display, a correlation with environment was only observed in males. Our study provides evidence for a strong relationship between signal design and prevailing environmental conditions, which may result from differential selection on signal efficacy. Moreover, our study highlights the importance of including females when studying dewlaps in an evolutionary context.},

Simpson hypothesized that species enter new adaptive zones in one of three ways: extinction of competitor species, dispersal to a new geographic region, or the evolution of a key trait that allows species to exploit resources in a new way. However, direct tests of Simpson's hypotheses for the entry into new adaptive zones remain elusive. Here we evaluate the fit of a Simpsonian model of jumps between adaptive zones to phylogenetic comparative data. We use a novel statistical approach to show that anoles, a well-studied adaptive radiation of Caribbean lizards, have evolved by a series of evolutionary jumps in trait evolution. Furthermore, as Simpson predicted, trait axes strongly tied to habitat specialization show jumps that correspond with the evolution of key traits and/or dispersal between islands in the Greater Antilles. We conclude that jumps are commonly associated with major adaptive shifts in the evolutionary radiation of anoles.},

  abstract = {There have been many different and conflicting definitions of mimicry. Some of the definitions of mimicry include crypsis and others do not. Each definition includes different groups of phenomena and uses different criteria to distinguish mimetic from non-mimetic phenomena. The confusion is eliminated by a consideration of the criteria of all definitions. This shows that there are in fact three major criteria dividing six phenomona, rather than a single dichotomy between mimicry and crypsis (Table 2). The criteria are defined by the results of a mistake in discrimination between the model and mim\`ic: (a) the mistake does or does not depend upon relationship between mimic and background; (b) the mistake has or has no effect on the population dynamics or evolution of the model and (c) the mistake affects dynamics or evolution of one or of many models. The main reason for the contusion about mimicry and crypsis is that each author's definition includes differing and partially overlapping subsets of the six classes: crypsis; masquerade; Batesism; M\"ullerism; polymorphism and convergence.},

  abstract = {Animal color pattern phenotypes evolve rapidly. What influences their evolution? Because color patterns are used in communication, selection for signal efficacy, relative to the intended receiver's visual system, may explain and predict the direction of evolution. We investigated this in bowerbirds, whose color patterns consist of plumage, bower structure, and ornaments and whose visual displays are presented under predictable visual conditions. We used data on avian vision, environmental conditions, color pattern properties, and an estimate of the bowerbird phylogeny to test hypotheses about evolutionary effects of visual processing. Different components of the color pattern evolve differently. Plumage sexual dimorphism increased and then decreased, while overall (plumage plus bower) visual contrast increased. The use of bowers allows relative crypsis of the bird but increased efficacy of the signal as a whole. Ornaments do not elaborate existing plumage features but instead are innovations (new color schemes) that increase signal efficacy. Isolation between species could be facilitated by plumage but not ornaments, because we observed character displacement only in plumage. Bowerbird color pattern evolution is at least partially predictable from the function of the visual system and from knowledge of different functions of different components of the color patterns. This provides clues to how more constrained visual signaling systems may evolve.},

We used a visual fixation reflex as an assay to test the effects of stimulus versus background chromatic and brightness contrast on the probability of detecting a moving coloured (i.e. dewlap-like) stimulus in Anolis cristatellus. The probability of stimulus detection depended on two additive visual-system channels, one responding to brightness contrast and one responding to chromatic contrast, independent of brightness. The brightness channel was influenced only by wavelengths longer than 450nm and probably received input only from middle- and/or long-wavelength photoreceptors. The chromatic contrast channel appeared to receive input from three, or possibly four, different classes of cone in the anoline retina, including one with peak sensitivity in the ultraviolet. We developed a multi-linear regression equation that described most of the results of this study to a reasonable degree of accuracy. In the future, this equation could be used to predict the relative visibility of different-coloured stimuli in different habitat light conditions, which should be very useful for testing hypotheses that attempt to relate habitat light conditions and visual-system response to the evolution of signal design.},

Taxa whose diversification occurred disproportionately early in their evolutionary history partition more of their morphological disparity among, rather than within, subclades. This inverse relationship between timing of diversification and morphological disparity within subclades may be a general feature that transcends the historically contingent properties of different evolutionary radiations.

  abstract = {Convergent evolution has played an important role in the development of the ecological niche concept. We investigated patterns of convergent and divergent evolution of Caribbean Anolis lizards. These lizards diversified independently on each of the islands of the Greater Antilles, producing the same set of habitat specialists on each island. Using a phylogenetic comparative framework, we examined patterns of morphological convergence in five functionally distinct sets of morphological characters: body size, body shape, head shape, lamella number, and sexual size dimorphism. We find evidence for convergence among members of the habitat specialist types for each of these five datasets. Furthermore, the patterns of convergence differ among at least four of the five datasets; habitat specialists that are similar for one set of characters are often greatly different for another. This suggests that the habitat specialist niches into which these anoles have evolved are multidimensional, involving several distinct and independent aspects of morphology.},

However, few studies have investigated how changes in habitat use alter the partitioning of an animal's behaviors into different microhabitats. In eastern Florida, the native lizard Anolis carolinensis is known to change its habitat use in the presence of invasive Anolis sagrei by perching higher in the canopy. We assessed behavioral partitioning in island populations of A. carolinensis that are sympatric with A. sagrei compared with islands where A. carolinensis is allopatric. We found that individuals of A. carolinensis exhibited behavioral partitioning, feeding relatively lower and displaying relatively higher than their initial perch height in both the presence and absence of A. sagrei. However, the relative locations chosen for feeding and displaying were not affected by the presence of A. sagrei, suggesting that habitat changes need not affect behavioral partitioning.},

  abstract = {Our understanding of animal mating systems has changed dramatically with the advent of molecular methods to determine individuals' reproductive success. But why are older behavioral descriptions and newer genetic descriptions of mating systems often seemingly inconsistent? We argue that a potentially important reason for such inconsistencies is a research trajectory rooted in early studies that were equivocal and overreaching, followed by studies that accepted earlier conclusions at face value and assumed, rather than tested, key ideas about animal mating systems. We illustrate our argument using Anolis lizards, whose social behavior has been studied for nearly a century. A dominant view emerging from this behavioral research was that anoles display strict territorial polygyny, where females mate with just the one male in whose territory they reside. However, all genetic evidence suggests that females frequently mate with multiple males. We trace this mismatch to early studies that concluded that anoles are territorial based on limited data. Subsequent research assumed territoriality implicitly or explicitly, resulting in studies that were unlikely to uncover or consider important any evidence of anoles' departures from strict territorial polygyny. Thus, descriptions of anole behavior were largely led away from predicting a pattern of female multiple mating. We end by considering the broader implications of such erratic trajectories for the study of animal mating systems and posit that precise definitions, renewed attention to natural history, and explicitly questioning assumptions made while collecting behavioral observations will allow us to move towards a fuller understanding of animal mating systems.},

Here, we respond by reiterating how our understandings of territoriality and of mating systems in Anolis and other animals have long been intertwined. Moreover, we argue that our definition of territoriality is precisely well suited to investigating mismatches between behavioral and genetic descriptions of mating systems.},

The purified SWS1Ac, SWS2Ac, RH1Ac, RH2Ac, LWSAc, and PAc pigments have the wavelengths of maximal absorption at 358, 437, 491, 495, 560, and 482 nm, respectively. SWS1Ac is the first vertebrate UV opsin whose spectral sensitivity has been directly evaluated. RH1 pigments, orthologous to the rod pigments of other vertebrates, are sensitive to hydroxylamine in the dark, exhibiting a cone pigment-like characteristic, probably reflecting their adaptation to the pure cone retina. Interestingly, the blue-sensitive SWS2Ac pigment shows an exceptionally low level of sensitivity to hydroxylamine, possessing a rod pigment-like characteristic.},

  abstract = {Sympatric speciation, the origin of two or more species from a single local population, has almost certainly been involved in formation of several species flocks, and may be fairly common in nature. The most straightforward scenario for sympatric speciation requires disruptive selection favouring two substantially different phenotypes, and consists of the evolution of reproductive isolation between them followed by the elimination of all intermediate phenotypes. Here we use the hypergeometric phenotypic model to show that sympatric speciation is possible even when fitness and mate choice depend on different quantitative traits, so that speciation must involve formation of covariance between these traits. The increase in the number of variable loci affecting fitness facilitates sympatric speciation, whereas the increase in the number of variable loci affecting mate choice has the opposite effect. These predictions may enable more cases of sympatric speciation to be identified.},

Whole-organism performance abilities have previously been shown to enhance both survival and reproductive success in a range of taxa, and females who mate with high-performance males might therefore gain significant indirect performance benefits. We tested the hypothesis that females associate preferentially with high-performance males in the green anole lizard Anolis carolinensis in laboratory trials using multivariate statistical techniques. Our results indicate that male performance abilities do not influence female mating preferences, either in isolation or as a combined suite of traits. Thus, any indirect performance benefits that a female might gain for her offspring are likely not a result of a female choice process.},

We investigated the relative roles of a male sexual signal (dewlap size) and whole-organism performance capacity (bite force) on male combat outcomes in nine species of Caribbean Anolis lizards that differ markedly in territoriality, as indicated by sexual size dimorphism. We found that (1) dewlap size was generally an honest signal of bite force in dimorphic but not less dimorphic species; (2) maximum bite force consistently predicted male combat success in dimorphic but not less dimorphic species; (3) in contrast to a priori predictions, dewlap size significantly predicted male combat success in less dimorphic but not dimorphic species; and (4) the incidence of biting but not dewlapping increases as species become more dimorphic. These findings suggest that more dimorphic (and hence more territorial) species escalate to biting during fights more readily compared with less territorial species. The ecological and behavioral qualities of species may therefore modify both the shape and the size of sexually selected traits as well as the nature of the information those traits convey.},

However, the factors underlying such changes are poorly understood. In male Anolis carolinensis lizards, a morphological secondary sexual signal called the dewlap changes size seasonally within individuals. Here, we test the hypothesis that seasonal changes in male dewlap size are driven by increased use and extension of the dewlap in spring and summer, when males are breeding, relative to the winter and fall. We captured male green anole lizards prior to the onset of breeding and constrained the dewlap in half of them such that it could not be extended. We then measured dewlap area in the spring, summer, and winter, and dewlap skin and belly skin elasticity in summer and winter. Dewlaps in unconstrained males increase in area from spring to summer and then shrink in the winter, whereas the dewlaps of constrained males consistently shrink from spring to winter. Dewlap skin is significantly more elastic than belly skin, and skin overall is more elastic in the summer relative to winter. These results show that seasonal changes in dewlap size are a function of skin elasticity and display frequency, and suggest that the mechanical properties of signaling structures can have important implications for signal evolution and design.},

Alsophis portoricensis subduing time of Anolis cristatellus increased linearly with time the lizard spent biting the snake. Some of the behaviors (dewlapping, head-bobbing, lateral body compression, lateral face-off, pushups, and tongue-bunch) exhibited by A. cristatellus during predation episodes are also used by these lizards during social interactions. We propose, then, that all these behaviors be considered multipurpose behaviors of A. cristatellus.}

  abstract = {The ecological consequences of reduced competition in West Indian Anolis lizards were investigated by comparing the range of habitats, perch heights, microclimatic sites and prey sizes utilized by populations coexisting with different numbers of competitors. The results of this analysis indicate that expansion occurs along all of these niche dimensions on islands where anoles are released from competition. The utilization of prey taxa, however, remains fairly constant even where populations shift into the foraging niches of missing species. Although Anolis sagrei on Abaco Island has undergone habitat expansion, the adult males do not exhibit the increases in body size, perch height distribution and prey size variation characteristic of other solitary anoles. The divergent ecology and evolution of A. sagrei in the northern Bahamas may be a consequence of competition with an unusually diverse insectivorous bird fauna. The absence of arboreal anoles from Abaco and Grand Bahama also supports this hypothesis. But conclusive evidence of competitive interaction between lizards and birds awaits further field studies. Finally, overlap in structural habitat, prey size and prey taxa was considerably higher among Jamaican anoles compared to species on Exuma Island. Total niche overlap, however, may be similar in both communities since the Jamaican species apparently tolerate less overlap in microclimatic sites and associated body temperatures.}

The outgroup Polychrus marmoratus was also examined to gain insight into the ancestral condition. Except for Anolis carolinensis, which is known to use vitamin A(2) as its visual pigment chromophore, all anoline species examined possessed at least four vitamin-A(1)-based visual pigments with maximum absorbance (lambda(max)) at 564, 495, 455 and 365 nm. To the previously reported visual pigments for A. carolinensis we add an ultraviolet-sensitive one with lambda(max) at 365 nm. Five common classes of oil droplet were measured, named according to apparent color and associated with specific cone classes - yellow and green in long-wavelength-sensitive (LWS) cones, green only in medium-wavelength-sensitive (MWS) cones and colorless in short-wavelength-sensitive (SWS) and ultraviolet-sensitive (UVS) cones. MSP data showed that the colorless droplet in the SWS cone had significant absorption between 350 and 400 nm, while the colorless droplet in the UVS cone did not. The pattern for Polychrus marmoratus was identical to that for the anoles except for the presence of a previously undescribed visual cell with a rod-like outer segment, a visual pigment with a lambda(max) of 497 nm and a colorless oil droplet like that in the UVS cones. These findings suggest that anoline visual pigments, as far as they determine visual system spectral sensitivity, are not necessarily adapted to the photic environment or to the color of significant visual targets (e.g. dewlaps).},

Intraspecific encounters between pairs of A. marcanoi with altered dewlaps revealed no higher level of aggression than the normal interspecific encounters.

  abstract = {Twenty-seven islands in the Lesser Antilles contain either one or two species of Anolis lizards. On nine of the ten two-species islands, the species differ substantially in size; 16 of the 17 one-species islands harbor an intermediate-sized species. Two processes could produce such a pattern: size adjustment (or character displacement), in which similar-sized species evolve in different directions in sympatry; and size assortment, in which only different-sized species can successfully colonize the same island together. Previous analyses implicitly have assumed that size is evolutionarily plastic and determined solely by recent ecological conditions, and consequently have tested the hypothesis that character displacement has occurred on each of the ten two-species islands. Other studies have focused only on size assortment. By analyzing such patterns in a phylogenetic context, I explicitly consider historical effects and can distinguish between size adjustment and size assortment. Using a minimum evolution algorithm, I assess evidence for size adjustment by partitioning changes in size along branches of the phylogenetic tree. Size evolution appears rare (a minimum of 4-7 instances of substantial size evolution). In the northern (but not the southern) Lesser Antilles, size change was significantly greater when a descendant taxon occurred on a two-species island and its hypothetical ancestor occurred on a one-species island, thus supporting the size adjustment hypothesis, though size adjustment might have occurred only once. The relative rarity of size evolution suggests that size assortment might be responsible for nonrandom patterns. In both the northern and southern Lesser Antilles, a null model of no size assortment is convincingly rejected. Closely related taxa, however, are usually similar in size, and hybridization between species has been reported. Consequently, similar-sized species might not coexist because they interbreed and coalesce into one gene pool. A null model that only allows species from different ``clades'' to co-occur is rejected for the northern Lesser Antilles, but is ambiguous with regard to the southern Lesser Antilles. Thus, competitive exclusion is probably responsible for the pattern of size assortment in the northern Lesser Antilles; both competitive exclusion and interbreeding of closely related species of similar size might be responsible for the patterns evident in the southern Lesser Antilles.},

The more different the recipient island's vegetation from that of the source, the greater the magnitude of differentiation.

  abstract = {Populations of the lizards Anolis carolinensis and A. sagrei were experimentally introduced onto small islands in the Bahamas. Less than 15 years after introduction, we investigated whether the populations had diverged and, if so, whether differentiation was related to island vegetational characteristics or propagule size. No effect of founding population size was evident, but differentiation of A. sagrei appears to have been adaptive, a direct relationship existed between how vegetationally different an experimental island was from the source island and how much the experimental population on that island had diverged morphologically. Populations of A. carolinensis had also diverged, but were too few for quantitative comparisons. A parallel exists between the divergence of experimental populations of A. sagrei and the adaptive radiation of Anolis lizards in the Greater Antilles; in both cases, relative hindlimb length and perch diameter are strongly correlated. This differentiation could have resulted from genetic change or environmentally-driven phenotypic plasticity. Laboratory studies on A. sagrei from a population in Florida indicate that hindlimb length exhibits adaptive phenotypic plasticity. Further studies are required to determine if the observed differences among the experimental populations are the result of such plasticity. Regardless of whether the differences result from plasticity, genetic change, or both, the observation that anole populations differentiate rapidly and adaptively when exposed to novel environmental conditions has important implications for understanding the adaptive radiation of Caribbean anoles.},

Work on the North American green anole (Anolis carolinensis) and the anoles of Puerto Rico has shown that skin coloration results from the combined effects of pigments-pteridines, carotenoids, and melanin-and structural colors produced by reflecting platelet arrays in dermal iridophores. We conducted a study of skin pigments in the Jamaican radiation of anoles, known as the 'grahami series', to examine how these anoles compare with those previously studied. We also wished to determine the histological basis for a strongly UV reflective dewlap that occurs in the only non-Jamaican member of the seven-species radiation, Anolis conspersus from Grand Cayman. We used thin layer chromatography to identify pteridines, spectrophotometry to detect carotenoids, and histology to reveal patterns of melanin in the skin of the study species. Our results are discussed in light of previously published work on Anolis coloration, and we describe a pigmentary novelty that is unique to A. conspersus within the grahami series.},

A key source of evidence that present-day selection can override historically contingent effects comes from the repeated evolution of similar adaptations in different taxa. Yet classic examples of repeated evolution are often among closely related taxa, suggesting the likelihood that similar adaptations evolve is contingent on the length of time separating taxa. To resolve this, we performed a meta-analysis of published reports of repeated evolution.},

  abstract = {The origin of new species can be influenced by both deterministic and stochastic factors. Mate choice and natural selection may be important deterministic causes of speciation (as opposed to the essentially stochastic factors of geographic isolation and genetic drift). Theoretical models predict that speciation is more likely when mate choice depends on an ecologically important trait that is subject to divergent natural selection, although many authors have considered such mating/ecology pleiotropy, or ``magic-traits'' to be unlikely. However, phenotypic signals are important in both mate choice and ecological processes such as avoiding predation. In chemically defended species, it may be that the phenotypic characteristics influencing mate choice are the same signals being used to transmit a warning to potential predators, although few studies have demonstrated this in wild populations. We tested for assortative mating between two color morphs of the Strawberry Poison-Dart Frog, Dendrobates pumilio, a group with striking geographic variation in aposematic color patterns. We found that females significantly prefer individuals of their own morph under two different light treatments, indicating strong assortative mating based on multiple coloration cues that are also important ecological signals. This study provides a rare example of one phenotypic trait affecting both ecological viability and nonrandom mating, indicating that mating/ecology pleiotropy is plausible in wild populations, particularly for organisms that are aposematically colored and visually orienting.},

There is a tendency to converge associated with structural-habitat similarity: Males of species whose range projections on a map do not overlap are significantly closer in size if structural habitats are similar than if different. There is a tendency to diverge associated with spatial overlap: Species with substantial structural habitat similarity are more different in head and snout-vent length if their ranges overlap than if allopatric. When a given species overlaps in part of its range with a second smaller species of similar structural habitat, convergence in head and snout-vent length is about as frequent as divergence; that is, the given species is as likely to increase its size as to decrease that size. Relatively large species converge significantly more often in this situation than do smaller species. However, where a given species overlaps in part of its range with a second larger species, divergence (a decrease in size) of the given species occurs much more often than convergence. If character divergence involves an increase in size, the factor of that increase is significantly less than if it involves a decrease. Ratios of head length are usually greater than 1.5 among spatially overlapping species on two species islands and are often so on the richest islands. Associations of three spatially overlapping Anolis species nearly always show the greatest head-length ratio between the two largest species.}

For DNA sequence data, the same formula can be used if FST is replaced by NST. In a population with restricted dispersal, analytic theory shows that there is a simple relationship between {\^M} and geographic distance in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium populations and that this relationship is approximately independent of mutation rate when the mutation rate is small. Simulation results show that with reasonable sample sizes, isolation by distance can indeed be detected and that, at least in some cases, non-equilibrium patterns can be distinguished. This approach to analyzing isolation by distance is used for two allozyme data sets, one from gulls and one from pocket gophers.},

For this reason, I tested the hypothesis that the display of the male's dewlap during courtship affects male mating success in the lizard Anolis sagrei. The hypothesis was tested in the laboratory by comparing the mating success of experimental males that were surgically prevented from extending their dewlaps to control males that were not prevented from extending their dewlaps. Males in the two treatment groups were housed in individual cages for one week before being used in mating tests. One day prior to the mating tests, I visually exposed a male from each treatment group to the female that it would be paired with during the mating test. On the day of the mating test, each male was removed from its cage and placed into the cage housing the female that it had been able to view. The behavior of the paired males and females was videotaped for two hours. The results did not support the hypothesis. Experimental males did not differ significantly from control males in number of copulations. Moreover, experimental and control males did not differ significantly in the latency period to copulation, copulation duration, or in the sexual receptivity of their female partners. These results provide no evidence that dewlap extension during courtship affects male mating success in Anolis sagrei, at least when males and females are in relatively close physical proximity to each other.},

  abstract = {Extension and retraction of the throat fan or dewlap is one of the most conspicuous aspects of display behavior of male Anolis lizards. Although dewlap display plays a role in species recognition, signal detection, and even predator defense, the importance of the male dewlap in male mating success in nature has not been established. The present study tested whether the display of the dewlap by males of Anolis sagrei affected the mating success of free-ranging males. We compared the number of males that copulated and their copulation rates between two groups: experimental males that were surgically prevented from extending their dewlaps and control males that were sham treated. Experimental and control groups did not differ significantly in the proportion of males that copulated or in copulation rate. These results do not support the hypothesis that the male dewlap affects male mating success in A. sagrei. If the male dewlap does have an effect on male mating success in this species, then the effect was too subtle to be detected by our study.},

  abstract = {1 The theory of the evolution of secondary sexual traits through male\textendash male competition is based on the assumption that these traits are reliable cues for an animal's fighting capacity. In this paper, we test whether a secondary sexual trait, dewlap size, is an honest predictor of bite strength in Anolis lizards. Since male anoles will bite one another during territorial fights, bite performance may play an important role in determining the outcome of male\textendash male fights. 2 We measured dewlap size and bite force in a size series of adult males of three Jamaican anoles, i.e. Anolis grahami Gray 1845, A. lineatopus Gray 1840 and A. valencienni Dum\'eril \& Bibron 1837. 3 In both A. grahami and A. lineatopus, males with relatively large dewlaps tend to bite relatively harder, while the relationship between relative dewlap size and bite force was clearly non-significant within the twig anole A. valencienni. 4 Our results thus suggest that dewlap size is an indicator of relative bite force in the former two species, but not in the latter. We argue that interspecific variation in territorial behaviour might explain this difference.},

  abstract = {Animal signalling systems are extremely diverse as they are under different, often conflicting, selective pressures. A classic textbook example of a diverse signal is the anoline dewlap. Both at the inter- and intraspecific levels, dewlap size, colour, shape and pattern vary extensively. Here, we attempt to elucidate the various factors explaining the diversity in dewlap size and pattern among seven Anolis sagrei populations from different islands in the Bahamas. The seven islands differ in the surface area, number and kind of predators, sexual size dimorphism and Anolis species composition. In addition, we investigate whether selective pressures acting on dewlap design differ between males and females. Whereas dewlap pattern appears to serve a role in species recognition in both sexes, our data suggest that relative dewlap size is under natural and/or sexual selection. We find evidence for the role of the dewlap as a pursuit-deterrence signal in both males and females as relative dewlap size is larger on islands where A. sagrei occurs sympatrically with predatory Leiocephalus lizards. Additionally, in males relatively large dewlaps seem to be selected for in a sexual context, whereas in females natural selection, for instance by other predators than Leiocephalus lizards, appears to constrain relative dewlap size.},

  abstract = {Speciation\textemdash the origin of new species\textemdash is the source of the diversity of life. A theory of speciation is essential to link poorly understood macro-evolutionary processes, such as the origin of biodiversity and adaptive radiation, to well understood micro-evolutionary processes, such as allele frequency change due to natural or sexual selection. An important question is whether, and to what extent, the process of speciation is `adaptive', i.e., driven by natural and/or sexual selection. Here, we discuss two main modelling approaches in adaptive speciation theory. Ecological models of speciation focus on the evolution of ecological differentiation through divergent natural selection. These models can explain the stable coexistence of the resulting daughter species in the face of interspecific competition, but they are often vague about the evolution of reproductive isolation. Most sexual selection models of speciation focus on the diversification of mating strategies through divergent sexual selection. These models can explain the evolution of prezygotic reproductive isolation, but they are typically vague on questions like ecological coexistence. By means of an integrated model, incorporating both ecological interactions and sexual selection, we demonstrate that disruptive selection on both ecological and mating strategies is necessary, but not sufficient, for speciation to occur. To achieve speciation, mating must at least partly reflect ecological characteristics. The interaction of natural and sexual selection is also pivotal in a model where sexual selection facilitates ecological speciation even in the absence of diverging female preferences. In view of these results, it is counterproductive to consider ecological and sexual selection models as contrasting and incompatible views on speciation, one being dominant over the other. Instead, an integrative perspective is needed to achieve a thorough and coherent understanding of adaptive speciation.},
