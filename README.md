# dewlap

This repository accompanies our study on dewlap coloration across habitats and islands in the Caribbean lizard species *Anolis sagrei*. We provide here our data, scripts, results and manuscript. The manuscript was accepted in Journal of Evolutionary Biology (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14209101) in March 2022.
