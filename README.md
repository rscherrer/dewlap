# dewlap

This repository accompanies our study on dewlap coloration across habitats and islands in the Caribbean lizard species *Anolis sagrei*. We provide here our data, scripts, results and manuscript. The manuscript was accepted in [Journal of Evolutionary Biology](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14209101) in March 2022. 
This repository is hosted at [https://github.com/rscherrer/dewlap](https://github.com/rscherrer/dewlap). 
A subset (data, metadata and code) is hosted at [Dryad](https://datadryad.org).
The data for this project were collected in 2015 in the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands using a reflectance spectrometer (see manuscript). All the data were analyzed in R 3.6.1 (all scripts provided).

## Content
